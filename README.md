## Goal
The goal of this project is to create a simple infographic about Ghibli films using Tableau. Also, to put into practice what I've learned about Tableau from online courses.

## Dataset
The data used in this project is obtained from unofficial [Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/) that contains information about Ghibli movies and from [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) (Open Movie Database) containing information about thousands of movies, including Ghibli movies to complement information missing from Ghibli API.

## Steps
The steps used to complete this project are:
- Collecting the data from the API using Python
- Cleaning the dataset before using it in Tableau
- Creating several visualizations in Tableau
- Arranging the visualizations made before in the Tableau dashboard

## Tools
The tools and package used in this project are:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy and Pandas
- Requests, DateTime, and Regex
- Tableau

## Result
The project result as Tableau dashboard can be seen [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/yosiadityan#!/vizhome/TheNumberBehindGhibliFilms/TheNumberBehindGhibliFilms).
